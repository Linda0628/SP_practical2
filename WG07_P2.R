################ In the picture:
## 1. The red curve(using zoe app) grows more slowly than the black curve( in the first 90 days). 
##   However, this group over a longer period of time 
##   and at a higher peak than the general population. 

## 2. It is obvious that the green curve(random sample) is basically consistent with the black curve(population), 
##    indicating that the normalized random sample is correct. 

## 3. From the 60th day to the 90th day, there was a significant increase in the curve

## 4. Compare the pictures given in the question, The figures we created in SEIR model coincide closely
##    with the result of the actual daily Covid deaths data in the left graph
##    (Among all 10 graphs, the first graph in 'visualization result 1.png' is more fitted)

## 5. Combined with the actual situation diagram, we can see that in the 0-100 day , the peak time is about 80-90 day.
##    this can be explained by R numbers(it was greater than 1 during this period),which means the 
##    infected people have high probability to transmit virus.
##    After that, the government imposed a national lockdown on day 95, R number drops below 1.
##    As a result, the number of new daily cases has dropped sharply.



################ Inference:
## 1. As can be seen from the figure, people with a strong sense of protection may not be able to 
##    keep away from the virus, but may take longer to spread the disease for some reason 
##    (they miss the time of herd immunity, making their immunity lower than the population).

## 2. We were surprised to find that people with stronger awareness of protection had a higher peak value. 
##    One possibility is that the model selected cannot reflect the actual situation, 
##    or the transfer probability may not be constant and may increase or decrease with the development of the epidemic.
##    (In fact ,from the change of R number in actual scenarios, it indicates that E2I is not a constant) 
##    While log Normal distribution may not fit the description of contact rate, we may try another model.
